# Description

This program randomly chooses a positive integer. The user will have a few chances to guess the number correctly. In each wrong attempt, the computer will give a hint that the number is greater or smaller. Optionally, the user is also allowed to find out more information about the number, by querying the variable attributes.

# Installation

pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ guess-number-game==0.0.1


# Use

To start playing the game:
```
import guess_number_game
guess_number_game.guess_number.play_game()
```

# Purpose

With this project I want to practice the following concepts:
1. DRY
2. Write functions that do only one thing
3. Compliance with pycodestyle
4. Unit testing
5. ~~Write classes~~
6. Package writing (the hard way - not with Cookie Cutter)

### Any feedback that would help me improve the program in the areas listed above, or other, would be very much welcomed. Many thanks in advance!


# To do
- to initialise the game, just type guess_number_game.play()
- something else?
