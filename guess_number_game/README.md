# Description

This program randomly chooses a positive integer. The user will have a few chances to guess the number correctly. In each wrong attempt, the computer will give a hint that the number is greater or smaller. Optionally, the user is also allowed to find out more information about the number, by querying the variable attributes.


# Purpose

With this project I want to practice the following concepts:
1. DRY
2. Write functions that do only one thing
3. Compliance with pycodestyle
4. Unit testing
5. Write classes
6. Package writing (the hard way - not with Cookie Cutter)

# Any feedback that would help me improve the program in the areas listed above, or other, would be very much welcomed. Many thanks in advance!
