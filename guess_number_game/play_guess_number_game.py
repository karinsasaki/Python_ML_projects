Title:
    Number Guessing

Description:
    Make a program which randomly chooses a positive integer to guess. The user will have a few chances to guess the number correctly. In each wrong attempt, the computer will give a hint that the number is greater or smaller. Optionally, the user is also allowed to find out more information about the number, by querying the variable attributes.
