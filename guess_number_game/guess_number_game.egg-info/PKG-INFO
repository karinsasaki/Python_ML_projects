Description: # Description
        
        This program randomly chooses a positive integer. The user will have a few chances to guess the number correctly. In each wrong attempt, the computer will give a hint that the number is greater or smaller. Optionally, the user is also allowed to find out more information about the number, by querying the variable attributes.
        
        
        # Purpose
        
        With this project I want to practice the following concepts:
        1. DRY
        2. Write functions that do only one thing
        3. Compliance with pycodestyle
        4. Unit testing
        5. Write classes
        6. Package writing (the hard way - not with Cookie Cutter)
        
        # Any feedback that would help me improve the program in the areas listed above, or other, would be very much welcomed. Many thanks in advance!
